                    <p id="tagline">Hey there! I’m Vaidic Soni, a sophomore at Texas State University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. 
                        Somewhere between writing my first "Hello, World!" and debugging a script at 2 AM, I realized that solving problems with code is what excites me the most.

                        <br><br>I’ve had a mix of experiences, some in classrooms, some in industry, and some just figuring things out as I go. At Pink Flower Higher Secondary School, 
                        I took on the roles of Teaching Assistant and IT Support Intern, mentoring students in open-source development, digital literacy, and Git/GitHub workflows. 
                        I automated administrative workflows with Python, built data visualization dashboards, and even helped optimize financial record-keeping—because spreadsheets, as it turns out, 
                        are just databases waiting to be coded into submission.

                        <br><br> I also dipped my toes into the world of software engineering through a virtual experience at Goldman Sachs, where I explored IT security and scalable web applications. 
                        When I’m not working, I’m usually building something like Weather Anytime, a Python-powered real-time weather app, or my portfolio website, where I experiment with UI/UX just for fun.
                        
                        <br><br> On campus, I do a bit of everything. As a Resident Assistant, I make sure my residents have a great living experience (and don’t set off the fire alarm at 3 AM). 
                        I previously worked as an Information Desk Assistant, where I was the go-to person for everything from campus resources to “Where’s the nearest vending machine?” I also lead the Math Club as President in High School, 
                        solving puzzles, organizing competitions, and occasionally questioning why I enjoy number theory so much. I am also an active member of the ACM AI club and when I’m not found there, you can find me exploring new developments in artificial intelligencea and the tech industry.

                        <br><br> Outside of all this, I spend an unhealthy amount of time watching soccer (despite my team’s ongoing heartbreaks), 
                        playing chess (where I mercilessly defeat my friends), and debating the mysteries of the universe. 
                        I love conversations that challenge my perspective—whether it’s about AI ethics or whether pineapple belongs on pizza (it doesn’t, by the way).

                        <br><br> I don’t know exactly where the future will take me, maybe building scalable software, maybe solving security challenges, 
                        maybe something I haven’t even thought of yet. But for now, I’ll keep learning, coding, and pushing boundaries, one problem at a time.
